# PyGame---FangDenHjorten

A silly 2D game coded in python using the PyGame package. This repository contains:

- main.py: This is a standalone python file that defines objects, auxilliary functions, game logic and finally runs the game.
- ___.png: graphics used in the game (many of these are self-made using pen/paper, and then enhanced in paint)
- boxcat.mp3: soundtrack used in the introduction
- bump.wav: only sound used in the game, when walking into trees/obstacles
